This is our CS 3110 Final Fall 2023 project, which implements the game of battleship. It enables users to play the classic game at two difficulty levels with some modern added abilities. These abilities include shielding a ship at a position for one round or peeking at one of the opponent's ships for one round. Players will be able to set the positions of each of their ships, choose positions to shoot on the computer opponent's board, and strategically moderate their usage of their shield and peek powers throughout the game. This game will be played in the terminal, enabling the user to see their board and any shields they are using for the current round. Additionally, a blank version of the computer opponent's board (AKA the tracking board) will be displayed with the shots/hits that the user has already played.
