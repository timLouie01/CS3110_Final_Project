  Our project is the game of battleship. It enables a user to play the classic game 
  of battleship as well as a modified version with additional functions each turn. 
  Playing against our program, the player will be able to set the positions of each ship, 
  and choose positions to shoot on our program's board. In the modified version of our game, 
  the player will be able to move their ship in game, use different types of ammunition, 
  and customize the size of the game board. 

  An interface in the terminal will enable the user to see their board, and a blank 
  version of the opponent's board (AKA the tracking board) with shots/hits they've 
  already played.
