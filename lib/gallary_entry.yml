  Our project is the game of battleship. It enables a user to play the classic 
  game at 2 levels of difficulty with some modern added abilities. 
  These abilities include shielding a ship at a position for 1 round or 
  peeking at one of the opponent's ships. Playing against our program, the 
  player will be able to set the positions of each of their ships, 
  choose positions to shoot on the computer opponent's board, 
  and moderate their usage of their shield and peek powers.

  This game will be played in the terminal and will enable the user to see their 
  board with shields shown if used and a blank version of the opponent's board 
  (AKA the tracking board) with the shots/hits they've already played.
